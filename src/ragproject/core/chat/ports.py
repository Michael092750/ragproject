"""The chat module's ports -- the abstractions it depends on.

Following the Dependency Inversion Principle, :class:`ChatService` is written
against these ``Protocol`` s, never against concrete adapters. Anything that
satisfies a port -- an in-memory fake in a test, Postgres in production -- is
substitutable without touching the service.

Adapters declare their port as an explicit base class (e.g.
``class LlmRouter(RetrievalRouter)``) so the abstraction-to-implementation link
is visible at the class and mypy verifies it at the definition site. The ports
stay ``Protocol`` s rather than ABCs, so explicit subclassing is opt-in:
:class:`RetrievalPort` is the deliberate exception -- left purely structural so
the pre-existing :class:`ragproject.core.retrieval.Retriever`, which lives in
``core`` and must not import ``chat``, can satisfy it without inheritance.

Generation reuses the existing :class:`ragproject.core.generation.LLM` port, so
it is not redefined here.
