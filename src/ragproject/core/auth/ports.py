"""The auth module's ports -- the abstractions it depends on.

Mirrors the chat module: :class:`AuthService` is written against this
``Protocol``, never a concrete store, so an in-memory fake (tests, local dev)
and Postgres (production) are interchangeable. Email is the unique natural key;
the service normalizes it (lowercased, trimmed) before any store call, so
implementations can compare it verbatim.
