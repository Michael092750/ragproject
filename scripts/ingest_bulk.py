"""Bulk-ingest a folder tree of reports into the shared knowledge base.

Each top-level subfolder is treated as a document *category* (industry):

    reports/AI/1.pdf       -> category "AI"
    reports/finance/2.pdf  -> category "finance"

The category is stored in each chunk's metadata, so retrieved hits are
attributable to an industry. Subfolders are walked recursively; only the first
path segment under the root is used as the category.

This is a thin CLI over :class:`industryiq.core.ingestion.IngestionService` --
the *same* code the scheduled job runs in the live service. It writes through the
configured pipeline (Milvus when ``VECTOR_BACKEND=milvus``; *both* pgvector and
Milvus when ``=both``, to load one corpus into both for benchmarking; else
pgvector/in-memory) and is idempotent: a re-run skips unchanged files and replaces
changed ones, tracked in the manifest. The manifest is durable only with
``DATABASE_URL`` set; without it the run still works but each run re-ingests the
whole tree.

Run with the SAME ``RAG_PROVIDER`` as the server, so the ingest-time and
query-time embedders match (a 384-dim local embedder and 1024-dim Titan are not
interchangeable against one store).

Usage:
    python scripts/ingest_bulk.py <folder>
