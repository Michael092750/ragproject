"""Bulk-ingest a folder tree of reports into the shared knowledge base.

Each top-level subfolder is treated as a document *category* (industry):

    reports/AI/1.pdf       -> category "AI"
    reports/finance/2.pdf  -> category "finance"

The category is stored in each chunk's metadata, so retrieved hits are
attributable to an industry. Subfolders are walked recursively; only the first
path segment under the root is used as the category.

Writes directly through RagPipeline (no HTTP), so it needs a *shared* store:
set DATABASE_URL to your Postgres so the running API sees the same data. Run the
SAME RAG_PROVIDER as the server, so the ingest-time and query-time embedders
match (a 384-dim local embedder and 1024-dim Titan are not interchangeable).

Usage:
    python scripts/ingest_bulk.py <folder>
